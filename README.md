# cinnamon
A better shell for human computer interaction

## Motivation
The Unix Philosophy is a great idea.
Things are so easy when you have a problem that can be solved by a single sequence of piped commands.

The problem comes when having to do anything more complex.

Since bash and all the other \*sh languages try to maintain general compatibility, they are full of edge cases that get in the way of progress.
Search for "bash best practices" and reminisce of all the time you've spent debugging because of these legacy decisions.

cinnamon aims to unlock the power of the unix utilities without worrying about backwards compatibility.
This way, we can get the best of all worlds and do less of the mundane parts of programming.
